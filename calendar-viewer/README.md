# Calendar Viewer for reTerminal E1001-E1005

A low-power calendar dashboard for the Seeed Studio reTerminal E1001, E1002,
E1003, E1004, and E1005. It loads a public iCalendar feed or Google calendars,
renders today's agenda together with week and month calendars, shows indoor
temperature and humidity plus a weather summary, and supports scheduled or
button-only low-power operation.

Calendar and weather APIs are checked no more than once every 15 minutes. The
e-paper panel refreshes only when visible calendar, weather, sensor, or date
content has changed.

## Features

- Public HTTP(S) `.ics` feeds, including folded text, all-day and timed events,
  exclusions, recurrence overrides, cancellation, and common daily, weekly,
  monthly, and yearly recurrence rules.
- All on-panel text uses embedded Noto Sans SemiCondensed Bold. Event titles
  include ASCII, Latin-1, Latin Extended, combining marks, punctuation, and
  currency symbols; no SD-card font files are required.
- Google Calendar through a Google Cloud service account, with optional
  Workspace domain-wide delegation.
- Calendar and event colors Floyd-Steinberg-dithered into each panel's native
  grayscale or six-color palette.
- A fixed dashboard with the current week above a six-week month grid and
  separate Today and Upcoming agendas above a compact weather card in the
  sidebar. Upcoming entries from the next six weeks include their date and
  start/end times, fill the available event space, and use a compact
  right-aligned `+N more` line only when needed. Week and month grids mark the
  current day in green on six-color panels.
- A dedicated E1005 portrait interface uses separate Today, Week, and Month
  pages. OK returns to the actual current day, while UP and DOWN move the active
  page backward or forward by one day, week, or month. While awake, the bottom
  tabs switch pages and tapping a Week row or Month cell opens Today for that
  date. The selected page and date remain active for scheduled refreshes.
- E1005 power mode defaults to **Deep sleep battery saver**: after five minutes
  without input it displays a button-wake message, enters deep sleep, disables
  timer wakeups, and wakes only from OK, UP, or DOWN. **Always on** keeps touch
  and buttons active and checks for updates at the configured interval.
- A wall-planner layout uses open column gutters, weekday/date labels inside
  the week cells, a light-blue weekday header above date-only month cells,
  horizontal week separators, rounded event bands, and clean white agenda and
  weather areas.
- Sunday is the default first day of the week; the Presentation settings can
  switch week and month grids to Monday-first.
- A Presentation toggle controls the single-Google-calendar background and
  defaults on. Plain grids shade non-current Saturdays and Sundays light gray.
- Shared Meteocons weather artwork plus native calendar, climate, location, and
  alert icons, with dithered light-blue calendar and light-yellow weather
  headers on six-color models.
- Indoor SHT4x temperature/humidity in the weather card and battery status in
  the header.
- Open-Meteo or QWeather summary, with optional severe-weather alerts.
- Captive-portal configuration for Wi-Fi, calendar, timezone, 12/24-hour time
  format, NTP, quiet hours, weather, refresh cadence, and diagnostics.
- An SD tab in the configuration portal can browse, upload, download, create,
  and delete files on the inserted microSD card.
- DHCP networking, NTP synchronization, PCF8563 clock restoration, quiet
  hours, low-battery handling, and deep sleep.
- iCalendar URLs, Google IAM credentials, weather credentials, and settings
  are stored in device NVS. Recent calendar data is cached in internal flash;
  credentials and calendar data are never written to the SD card.

Use the environment matching the physical device; panel drivers and
dimensions differ between models.

## Getting started

### 1. Flash the firmware

Use the repository
[web flasher](https://danpodeanu.github.io/seeed-reterminal-E100X/) and select
**Calendar Viewer** plus the exact reTerminal model. Chrome or Edge can flash
the release directly over USB-C.

To build from source instead, install
[PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install/cli), enter this directory,
and run:

```bash
pio run -e reterminal_e1001
```

Replace the environment with `reterminal_e1002`, `reterminal_e1003`,
`reterminal_e1004`, or `reterminal_e1005` as needed.

### 2. Open the configuration portal

On first boot, the device opens its own Wi-Fi access point and displays join
and settings QR codes. Scan both codes, then save the Wi-Fi, calendar, and
weather settings.

After the configured device restarts, it displays **Connecting to
&lt;Wi-Fi name&gt;** while it connects and synchronizes the clock. A centered
**Refreshing calendar** box is shown on interactive E1005 devices only while
calendar or weather providers are actually being queried. E1001-E1004 retain
the current calendar while fetching and redraw only when the resulting display
changes. Cache-only deep-sleep wakes do not start Wi-Fi.

To reopen the portal later, wake the sleeping device while holding the green
button (OK on E1005) for at least two seconds, then release it before five
seconds. In E1005 Always on mode, hold OK for two seconds while the calendar is
interactive. Press it again to leave the portal after saving. The **SD** tab
exposes the inserted microSD card through the same web UI.

### 3. Configure a calendar source

Choose one source under **Settings -> Calendar source**.

#### Google Calendar secret iCal URL

This is the simplest read-only setup for one Google/Gmail calendar. The link is
created in Google Calendar, not in the Gmail mailbox:

1. On a computer, open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) and sign
   in with the Google account that owns the calendar.
2. In the left sidebar, expand **My calendars**.
3. Point to the calendar to display, select its three-dot **More** menu, then
   select **Settings and sharing**.
4. In that calendar's settings, select or scroll to **Integrate calendar**.
5. Under **Secret address in iCal format**, select the copy button. Copy the
   complete HTTPS URL, which ends in `.ics`.
6. Open Calendar Viewer's configuration portal and go to **Settings ->
   Calendar source**.
7. Select **Ical**, paste the URL into **iCalendar URL**, then save.
8. Select **Reboot to viewer**.

Do not make the calendar public and do not use **Public address in iCal
format**. The secret address is a bearer credential: anyone who has it can read
the calendar. Give it only to trusted applications and devices, not to other
people. If it is disclosed, return to **Integrate calendar**, select **Reset**
beside the secret address to invalidate it, and save the new URL on the device.
Google Workspace administrators can disable secret addresses; if the field is
missing, ask the administrator or use the service-account method below.

For another calendar provider, use its complete HTTPS `.ics` subscription URL
and follow steps 6-8. Calendar Viewer stores the URL in NVS, never on the SD
card, and the portal returns only a "saved" placeholder after configuration.
HTTPS certificates are verified against the Mozilla root bundle supplied by
the ESP32 framework.

Common IANA `TZID` values covered by the portal's timezone presets are
converted with their own UTC offsets and daylight-saving rules. Unknown
`TZID` values are rejected instead of being displayed at the wrong time.
UTC, floating/local, all-day, `DURATION`, `EXDATE`, `RECURRENCE-ID`, and
daily/weekly/monthly/yearly `RRULE` forms are supported, including `WKST`,
monthly `BYDAY`, and `BYMONTHDAY`. Unsupported recurrence selectors are
reported as a feed error instead of silently producing a different schedule.

#### Google Calendar API with a service account

Use this method for Google calendar and event colors, multiple calendars, or a
dedicated shared calendar. Direct sharing does not require an OAuth consent
screen or Workspace domain-wide delegation.

##### Create the Google Cloud service account

1. Open the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), open the
   project selector in the top bar, and select **New project**.
2. Enter a project name such as `calendar-viewer`, select **Create**, then
   select the new project when creation finishes. An existing project is also
   suitable.
3. Open **APIs & Services -> Library**, search for **Google Calendar API**,
   open it, and select **Enable**.
4. Open **IAM & Admin -> Service Accounts** and select **Create service
   account**.
5. Enter a service account name such as `calendar-viewer`. Select **Create and
   continue**, leave the optional project-role field empty, then select
   **Continue** and **Done**. Calendar access is granted later in Google
   Calendar, so the service account needs no Google Cloud project role.
6. Select the new service account, open its **Keys** tab, then select **Add
   key -> Create new key -> JSON -> Create**.
7. Store the downloaded JSON file securely. Copy the service account address
   shown in the Cloud console or the value of `client_email` in that file. It
   resembles `calendar-viewer@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

Some organizations prohibit downloadable service-account keys. If **Create new
key** is unavailable or reports that key creation is disabled, an organization
administrator must permit it for the project before this firmware can use the
service account.

##### Share a calendar with the service account

1. On a computer, open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) as the
   calendar owner.
2. To make a dedicated shared calendar, select the **+** beside **Other
   calendars**, select **Create new calendar**, enter its name and time zone,
   then select **Create calendar**. Skip this step to use an existing calendar.
3. Under **My calendars**, point to the target calendar, select its three-dot
   **More** menu, then select **Settings and sharing**.
4. Open **Shared with** (called **Share with specific people or groups** in
   some versions of the UI), then select **Add people and groups**.
5. Paste the service account's `client_email`, choose **See event details** or
   **See all event details**, then select **Send**. Edit permission is not
   required. The calendar owner, or someone with permission to manage sharing,
   must perform this step.
6. In the same calendar settings, open **Integrate calendar** and copy
   **Calendar ID**. A primary calendar ID is often the owner's Gmail address;
   a secondary calendar commonly resembles
   `c_abc123@group.calendar.google.com`. This is not the secret iCal URL and is
   not the service account's email address.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for every calendar the device should display. Each calendar
   must be shared directly with the service account.

The service account has no inbox and does not click an invitation link.
Calendar Viewer uses each configured Calendar ID to add the shared calendar to
the service account's CalendarList on its first refresh.

##### Configure Calendar Viewer

1. Open the device configuration portal and go to **Settings -> Calendar
   source**.
2. Select **Google** and paste the Calendar IDs into **Google calendar IDs**,
   separated by commas. Leave **Google delegated user** empty for this
   directly-shared setup.
3. Save the settings, open the **Google IAM** tab, and upload the complete JSON
   key downloaded from Google Cloud.
4. Select **Reboot to viewer**. A newly created service account can take a
   minute to become usable; retry after a short wait if the first refresh
   reports that it cannot access the calendar.

Up to 12 calendars and 128 visible events are loaded per refresh. Leave
**Google calendar IDs** blank only to discover calendars already present in the
service account's CalendarList.

Google's corresponding instructions are [use a secret iCal
address](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37648),
[share a calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37082),
[enable a Workspace API](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/enable-apis),
[create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create),
and [create a JSON key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete).

For configured IDs, Calendar Viewer requests
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` and
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.calendarlist`. On the first refresh,
it reads each CalendarList entry and adds a missing subscription to the service
account's list. This allows events without their own `colorId` to inherit the
calendar entry's `backgroundColor`; explicitly colored events use Google's
event-color palette. When exactly one Google calendar is loaded and that
background color is available, the week and month cells use its dithered color.
Adding the subscription does not modify calendar events.

If color-enabled authentication reports an explicit scope/authorization error,
or CalendarList access returns HTTP 401/403, the firmware continues with
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly`. Events still load,
using the built-in color palette and default calendar color. For Workspace
domain-wide delegation, authorize the service account's OAuth client ID for all
three scopes above, then set **Google delegated user** to the user whose
calendars and display colors should be read.

The uploaded JSON is capped at 8 KiB and parsed in RAM. Only the required
service-account fields are saved in the `calendar` NVS namespace; the private
key is never placed on SD, returned by the status endpoint, or logged. The
portal can remove the stored credential. Standard ESP32 NVS is not encrypted
unless flash encryption is separately provisioned on the device.

Under **Settings -> Presentation**, choose Sunday (the default) or Monday as the
first day of the week and select either the default 12-hour am/pm clock or a
24-hour clock. The single-calendar background toggle defaults on; turn it off
to use white weekday cells and light-gray weekend cells.
Timed entries in the Today agenda show both their start and end times.

### 4. Configure weather

Open-Meteo is the default and needs only latitude, longitude, and a location
name. QWeather uses the same Ed25519 credentials and settings as Weather
Viewer. Temperature and wind units are configurable. Weather is cached in NVS
for the 15-minute refresh gate and temporary provider failures; no SD card is
required.

## Controls and refresh behavior

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Tap any front button on E1001-E1004 | Wake and show the latest cached data |
| Tap OK on E1005 | Return to the actual current day in Today |
| Tap UP on E1005 | Move back one day, week, or month in the active view |
| Tap DOWN on E1005 | Move forward one day, week, or month in the active view |
| Tap an E1005 bottom tab while awake | Switch directly to Today, Week, or Month |
| Tap an E1005 Week row or Month date while awake | Open Today for the selected date |
| Hold green, or OK on E1005, for at least 2 seconds | Open the configuration portal |
| Wait for the timer | Check for updates on E1001-E1004 or in E1005 Always on mode |

Calendar and weather results remain fresh for 15 minutes across deep sleep, so
shorter configured wake intervals and repeated button navigation do not repeat
provider requests. Failed provider attempts use the same gate rather than
retrying more frequently. Scheduled wakes are suppressed during configured
quiet hours on E1001-E1004.

E1005 defaults to **Deep sleep battery saver**. A cold boot or button wake
remains interactive until five minutes have elapsed without input; the bottom
bar then confirms that the device is sleeping and names the wake buttons.
Automatic timer wake is disabled in this mode. **Always on** never enters deep
sleep during normal operation, ignores quiet-hour sleep suppression, remains
interactive, and starts an update cycle at the configured interval. Its update
interval has a 15-minute minimum.

Calendar data for nearby periods is prefetched while E1005 interaction is
active. Navigation within that window never refetches truncated data. Browsing
beyond it waits until the 15-minute refresh gate opens, then reconnects only
long enough to load the requested period and turns Wi-Fi back off.

Successful refresh times are retained in RTC memory. Internal-flash calendar
and weather caches are rewritten only when visible provider data changes or at
a six-hour durable checkpoint, limiting flash wear.

After a successful fetch, Calendar Viewer compares the visible date window,
event data and colors, weather summary, power, and render-affecting
settings. Indoor climate refreshes only after temperature moves at least 1 C or
humidity moves at least 5 percentage points from the last rendered values.
Battery changes of fewer than 5 percentage points from the last rendered value
are ignored; changes of 5 points or more refresh the display. Plugging in or
returning to battery power also refreshes immediately. If none of those inputs
changed, panel initialization and refresh are skipped.
Before a changed frame is refreshed, the serial log identifies each changed
component and reports useful current values. The plain-white diagnostic
`Google checked` footer is updated whenever another component causes a refresh,
but its timestamp never triggers a refresh by itself. iCalendar download
failures preserve an existing calendar frame. E1005 battery saver waits for a
button after errors; scheduled modes retry without bypassing the 15-minute
provider-attempt gate. Google failures display the API error; an unchanged error
does not cause another panel refresh.

The five-second screenshot gesture is compiled out by default. A development
build can enable it with `-D CALENDAR_GREEN_SCREENSHOT_ENABLED=1`; holding green
(OK on E1005) for five seconds then saves the rendered page to
`/screenshot.png`. The two-second configuration gesture and SD web UI remain
enabled either way.

The **SD** page can browse, upload, download, delete, and create files and
folders. Its **Erase SD card** section reformats the card as FAT32 after
`FORMAT` is typed for confirmation. The format control remains available when
the card has no mountable filesystem so it can be used for recovery.

## Configuration storage

All runtime settings live in NVS and survive normal reflashing. The tracked
`include/secrets.h` contains placeholders only; compile-time Wi-Fi and
QWeather values are optional fallbacks for local builds. Never commit real
credentials.

Google credentials, iCalendar URLs, and calendar data are never written to the
SD card. When the optional screenshot gesture is enabled, it writes only
`/screenshot.png`; the SD web UI otherwise changes files only in response to
the operator.

The current NVS partition is 20 KiB. Typical Google service-account keys fit
alongside the app settings, but very large or unusually formatted IAM files
are rejected.

## Development

Run native parser, refresh-policy, and render-geometry tests:

```bash
pio test -c platformio-test.ini -e native_test
```

Build every supported model:

```bash
pio run -e reterminal_e1001
pio run -e reterminal_e1002
pio run -e reterminal_e1003
pio run -e reterminal_e1004
pio run -e reterminal_e1005
```

Serial logging uses UART1 on GPIO43/GPIO44 at 115200 baud. Google request
stages, HTTP statuses, response sizes, sanitized API errors, page counts, and
event counts are logged. Transport failures are retried once with a fresh TLS
connection and report sanitized Wi-Fi, DNS, TLS, and heap diagnostics. Display
refresh logs list the render components that changed without exposing calendar
URLs or credentials. OAuth tokens, signed JWTs, and private keys are
deliberately omitted.
